Hello! I'm Tuyen Tran and welcome to my homepage. I am a Ph.D student in Computer Vision at <a href='https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/'>Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute</a> (A<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup>), Deakin University, based in Australia. My research interest is about Video Understanding, especially on Action Recognition, Referring Video Ojbect Segmentation, and Video Event Understanding.

I use this homepage to share my research activities. I also write about topic that find interesting, which would be about Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and sometimes about my personal life.
